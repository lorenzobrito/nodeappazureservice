node app hosted on app service azure


Hi, App service is a sofware as service that Azure provide. It is a great start if you want to deploy your app on the cloud. 


I love App service for 2 main point of views. 


1.-Technology .- I can still remember how difficult for me was to set up server 10 years ago.
    I need to install opensuse, configure java environment and last the tomcat server,then you need to add your app. 
    After you have finish your sever set up, you would have to configure your home route, in order to check your app outside of the world. 
    Now with App services, just with few click you can have everything setup even for free. App service provide several layer, you can try 
    it, and then if you can scale up 
    

The prices are great, you can host it for free or
